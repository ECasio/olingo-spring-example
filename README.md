## How to run this application

What you find here is a working example of an olingo spring application.

You can run this app locally by executing the command 'mvn spring-boot:run' in the terminal of the project folder.

Using Postman you can then call the URL localhost:8080/odata/$metadata to fetch the metadata:

if you then call the Mothers(1) entity, you'll also get a positive result back:
